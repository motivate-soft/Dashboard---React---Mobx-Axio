  "web_companyWebsite": "Nowadays, a website is a virtual business card of a company. Usually, website constitutes the first interaction with prospective clients, and companies that don’t have one can appear to customers as unprepared, behind the trends and even amateurish.\n A great website needs to be fast, user-friendly, search engine optimized, rich with marketing content and engaging. B2B companies that maintain a proper website can benefit by collecting the data of potential users, generate new leads, connect new visitors to their additional social media channels and move clients throughout the sales funnel.",
  "web_landingPages": "A landing page is a standalone web page distinct from your main website that is designed for a single focused marketing objective. Usually, this means that your landing page should not have global navigation to your primary website. The main reason for this is to limit the options available to your visitors, helping to guide them towards your intended goal. There are two basic types of landing page, click through and lead generation.\n Click through landing pages have the goal of persuading the visitor to click through to another page. Typically they can be used to describe a product to “warm up” a visitor to the point where they are closer to making a purchasing decision.  Lead generation landing pages are used to capture user data, such as a name and email address. The sole purpose of the page is to collect information that will allow you to connect with them in the future. For example, you can use lead generation for ebook, whitepaper, webinar registration, etc."
